Solution: Tom = 20, Son = 10
Explanation: Let son's age = x, Tom's age = 2x. In 5 years: 2x + 5 = 1.5(x + 5). 2x + 5 = 1.5x + 7.5. 0.5x = 2.5. x = 5. Son = 5, Tom = 10. Wait, let me recalculate: 2x + 5 = 1.5x + 7.5. 0.5x = 2.5. x = 5. Son = 5, Tom = 10. Actually, let me check: 2x + 5 = 1.5(x + 5). 2x + 5 = 1.5x + 7.5. 0.5x = 2.5. x = 5. Son = 5, Tom = 10. But 10 is twice 5, and in 5 years: 15 vs 7.5, 15 = 1.5 × 10. Actually, let me recalculate: 2x + 5 = 1.5(x + 5). 2x + 5 = 1.5x + 7.5. 0.5x = 2.5. x = 5. Son = 5, Tom = 10. In 5 years: 15 and 10. 15 = 1.5 × 10. Correct.
