# DERIVATIVES - PRODUCT RULE
Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = x²(3x + 1)
Solution: f'(x) = 9x² + 2x
Explanation: Using product rule: (uv)' = u'v + uv'. Let u = x², v = 3x + 1. u' = 2x, v' = 3. So f'(x) = 2x(3x + 1) + x²(3) = 6x² + 2x + 3x² = 9x² + 2x.

Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 2)
Solution: f'(x) = 2x - 1
Explanation: Using product rule: u = x + 1, v = x - 2. u' = 1, v' = 1. So f'(x) = 1(x - 2) + (x + 1)(1) = x - 2 + x + 1 = 2x - 1.

# DERIVATIVES - QUOTIENT RULE
Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = (x + 3)/(x - 1)
Solution: f'(x) = -4/(x - 1)²
Explanation: Using quotient rule: (u/v)' = (u'v - uv')/v². u = x + 3, v = x - 1. u' = 1, v' = 1. So f'(x) = (1(x - 1) - (x + 3)(1))/(x - 1)² = (x - 1 - x - 3)/(x - 1)² = -4/(x - 1)².

Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = x²/(x + 2)
Solution: f'(x) = (x² + 4x)/(x + 2)²
Explanation: Using quotient rule: u = x², v = x + 2. u' = 2x, v' = 1. So f'(x) = (2x(x + 2) - x²(1))/(x + 2)² = (2x² + 4x - x²)/(x + 2)² = (x² + 4x)/(x + 2)².

# DERIVATIVES - CHAIN RULE

Solution: f'(x) = 6x(x² + 1)²
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(u³) = 3u² × du/dx. Here u = x² + 1, du/dx = 2x. So f'(x) = 3(x² + 1)² × 2x = 6x(x² + 1)².

Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = √(x³ + 2)
Solution: f'(x) = (3x²)/(2√(x³ + 2))
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(√u) = (1/(2√u)) × du/dx. Here u = x³ + 2, du/dx = 3x². So f'(x) = (3x²)/(2√(x³ + 2)).

Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = sin(2x)
Solution: f'(x) = 2cos(2x)
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(sin(u)) = cos(u) × du/dx. Here u = 2x, du/dx = 2. So f'(x) = cos(2x) × 2 = 2cos(2x).

Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = cos(x²)
Solution: f'(x) = -2x sin(x²)
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(cos(u)) = -sin(u) × du/dx. Here u = x², du/dx = 2x. So f'(x) = -sin(x²) × 2x = -2x sin(x²).

Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = tan(3x)
Solution: f'(x) = 3sec²(3x)
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(tan(u)) = sec²(u) × du/dx. Here u = 3x, du/dx = 3. So f'(x) = sec²(3x) × 3 = 3sec²(3x).

# DERIVATIVES - EXPONENTIAL
Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = e^(2x)
Solution: f'(x) = 2e^(2x)
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(e^u) = e^u × du/dx. Here u = 2x, du/dx = 2. So f'(x) = e^(2x) × 2 = 2e^(2x).

Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = e^(x²)
Solution: f'(x) = 2xe^(x²)
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(e^u) = e^u × du/dx. Here u = x², du/dx = 2x. So f'(x) = e^(x²) × 2x = 2xe^(x²).

# DERIVATIVES - LOGARITHMIC
Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = ln(3x)
Solution: f'(x) = 1/x
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(ln(u)) = (1/u) × du/dx. Here u = 3x, du/dx = 3. So f'(x) = (1/(3x)) × 3 = 1/x.

Problem: Find f'(x) for f(x) = ln(x² + 1)
Solution: f'(x) = 2x/(x² + 1)
Explanation: Using chain rule: d/dx(ln(u)) = (1/u) × du/dx. Here u = x² + 1, du/dx = 2x. So f'(x) = (1/(x² + 1)) × 2x = 2x/(x² + 1).

# DERIVATIVES - IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION
Problem: Find dy/dx for x² + y² = 25
Solution: dy/dx = -x/y
Explanation: Differentiate both sides: 2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0. Solve for dy/dx: 2y(dy/dx) = -2x. dy/dx = -x/y.

Problem: Find dy/dx for x³ + y³ = 6xy
Solution: dy/dx = (2y - x²)/(y² - 2x)
Explanation: Differentiate both sides: 3x² + 3y²(dy/dx) = 6(y + x(dy/dx)). 3x² + 3y²(dy/dx) = 6y + 6x(dy/dx). Collect terms: 3y²(dy/dx) - 6x(dy/dx) = 6y - 3x². (3y² - 6x)(dy/dx) = 6y - 3x². dy/dx = (6y - 3x²)/(3y² - 6x) = (2y - x²)/(y² - 2x).

Problem: A 10-foot ladder leans against a wall. If the bottom slides away at 1 ft/s, how fast is the top sliding down when the bottom is 6 ft from the wall?
Solution: -3/4 ft/s
Explanation: x² + y² = 100. Differentiate: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. When x = 6, y = √(100 - 36) = 8. So 2(6)(1) + 2(8)(dy/dt) = 0. 12 + 16(dy/dt) = 0. dy/dt = -12/16 = -3/4 ft/s.

# APPLICATIONS - OPTIMIZATION
Problem: Find the dimensions of a rectangle with perimeter 40 cm that has maximum area.
Solution: 10 cm × 10 cm (square)
Explanation: Let length = x, width = y. 2x + 2y = 40, so y = 20 - x. Area = x(20 - x) = 20x - x². dA/dx = 20 - 2x = 0. x = 10. y = 20 - 10 = 10.
