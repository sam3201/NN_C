imp, the body of Gorrister hung from the pink palette; 
| ee — hanging high above us in the computer 

chamber; and it did not shiver in the chill, oily breeze that 
‘blew eternally through the main cavern. The body hung head 
down, attached to the underside of the palette by the sole of its 
ight foot. It had been drained of blood through a precise inci- 
sion made from ear to ear under the lantem jaw. There was no 
blood on the reflective surface of the metal floor. 

When Gorrister joined our group and looked up himself, it 
was already too late for us to realize that once again AM had 
duped us, had had its fun; it had been a diversion on the part of 
the machine. Three of us had vomited, tuming away from one 
another in a reflex as ancient as the nausea that had produced it. 

Gorrister went white. It was almost as though he had seen a 
‘voodoo icon, and was afraid of the future. "Oh God," he mumbled, 
and walked away. The three of us followed him after a time, and 
found him sitting with his back to one of the smaller chittering 
banks, his head in his hands. Ellen knelt down beside him and 
stroked his hair. He didn't move, but his voice came out of his cov- 
ered face quite clearly. “Why doesn't it just do us in and get it over 
With? Christ, | don't know how much longer | can go on like this.* 

It was our one hundred and ninth year in the computer. 

He was speaking for all of us. 





imdok (which was the name the machine had forced him to 
N use, because AM amused itself with strange sounds) was 

hallucinating that there were canned goods in the ice cav- 
ems. Gorrister and | were very dubious. "It's another shuck," | told 
them. "Like the goddamn frozen elephant AM sold us. Benny 
almost went out of his mind over that one. We'll hike all that way 
and it'll be putrefied or some damn thing. | say forget it. Stay here, 
it'll have to come up with something pretty soon or we'll die." 

Benny shrugged. Three days it had been since we'd last 
eaten. Worms. Thick, ropey. 

Nimdok was no more certain. He knew there was the 
chance, but he was getting thin. It couldn't be any worse there, 
than here. Colder, out that didn't matter much. Hot, cold, hail, 
lava, boils, or locusts ~ it never mattered: the machine masturbat- 
ed and we had to take it or die. 

Ellen decided us. "I've got to have something, Ted. Maybe 
there'll be some Bartlett pears or peaches. Please, Ted, let's try it." 

| gave in easily. What the hell. Mattered not at all. Ellen was 
grateful, though. She took me twice out of tum. Even that had 
ceased to matter. And she never came, so why bother? But the 
machine giggled every time we did it. Loud, up there, back there, 
all around us, he snickered. It snickered. Most of the time | thought 
of AM as it, without a soul; but the rest of the time | thought of it 
as him, in the masculine . . . the patemal .. . the patriarchal... . for 
he is a jealous people. Him. It. God as Daddy the Deranged 

We left on a Thursday. The machine always kept us up-to- 
date on the date. The passage of time was important; not to us 
sure as hell, but to him . .. it... AM. Thursday. Thanis. 

Nimdok and Gorrister carried Ellen for a while, their hands 
locked to their own and each other's wrists, a seat. Benny and | 
walked before and after, just to make sure that if anything hap- 
pened, it would catch one of us and at least Ellen would be safe. 
Fat chance, safe. Didn't matter. 

It was only a hundred miles or so to the ice cavems, and 
the second day, when we were lying out under the blistering 
sunthing, he had materialized, he sent down some manna. Tasted 
like boiled boar urine. We ate it. 

On the third day we passed through a valley of obsoles- 
cence, filled with rusting carcasses of ancient computer banks, 2 


AM had been as ruthless with its own life as with ours. It was a 
mark of his personality: it strove for perfection. Whether it was a 
matter of killing off unproductive elements in his own world- 
filling bulk, or perfecting methods for torturing us, AM was as 
thorough as those who had invented him — now long since gone 
to dust — could ever have hoped. There was light filtering down 
from above, and we realized we must be very near the surface. 
But we didn't try to crawl up to see. There was virtually nothing 
out there; had been nothing that could be considered anything 
for over a hundred years. Only the blasted skin of what had once 
been the home of billions. Now there were only five of us, down 
here inside, alone with AM. 

| heard Ellen saying frantically, "No, Benny! Don't, come on, 
Benny, don't please!* 

‘And then | realized | had been hearing Benny murmuring, 
under his breath, for several minutes. He was saying, “I'm gonna 
get out, I'm gonna get out . . .* over and over. His monkey-like 
face was crumbled up in an expression of beatific delight and 
sadness, all at the same time. The radiation scars AM had given 
him during the “festival* were drawn down in a mass of pink- 
white puckerings, and his features seemed to work independent- 
ly of one another. Perhaps Benny was the luckiest of the five of us: 
he had gone stark, staring mad many years before. 

But even though we could call AM any damned thing we 
liked, could think the foulest thoughts of fused memory banks and 
corroded base plates, of bumt out circuits and shattered control 
bubbles, the machine would not tolerate our trying to escape. 
Benny leaped away from me as | made a grab for him. He scram- 
‘bled up the face of a smaller memory cube, tilted on its side and 
filled with rotted components. He squatted there for a moment, 
looking like the chimpanzee AM had intended him to resemble. 

Then he leaped high, caught a trailing beam of pitted and 
corroded metal, and went up it, hand-over-hand like an animal, 
till he was on a girdered ledge, twenty feet above us. 

"Oh, Ted, Nimdok, please, help him, get him down 
before-* She cut off. Tears began to stand in her eyes. She 
moved her hands aimlessly. 

It was too late, None of us wanted to be near him when 
whatever was going to happen, happened, And besicles, we all 
saw through her concem. When AM had altered Benny, during 
the machine's utterly irrational, hysterical phase, it was not merely 
Benny's face the computer had made like a giant ape's. He was 
big in the privates, she loved that! She serviced us, as a matter of 
course, but she loved it from him. Oh Ellen, pedestal Ellen, 
pristine-pure Ellen, oh Ellen the clean! Scum filth, 

Gorrister slapped her. She slumped down, staring up at 
poor loony Benny, and she cried. We had gotten used to it 
seventy-five years before. Gorrister kicked her in the side. 

Then the sound began. It was light, that sound. Half sound 
and half light, something that began to glow from Benny's eyes, 
and pulse with growing loudness, dim sonorities that grew more 
gigantic and brighter as the light/sound increased in tempo. It 
must have been painful, and the pain must have been increasing 
with the boldness of the light, the rising volume of the sound, for 
Benny began to mew/ like a wounded animal. At first softly, when. 
the light was dim and the sound was muted, then louder as his 
shoulders hunched together: his back humped, as though he was 
trying to get away from it. His hands folded across his chest like a 
chipmunk's. His head tilted to the side. The sad little monkey-face 
pinched in anguish. Then he began to howl, as the sound coming 
from his eyes grew louder. Louder and louder. | slapped the sides 
of my head with my hands, but | couldn't shut it out, it cut through 
easily. The pain shivered through my flesh like tinfoil on a tooth 

And Benny was suddenly pulled erect. On the girder he 
stood up, jerked to his feet like a puppet. The light was now 
pulsing out of his eyes in two great round beams. The sound 
crawled up and up some incomprehensible scale, and then he 
fell forward, straight down, and hit the plate-steel floor with a 
crash. He lay there jerking spastically as the light flowed around 
and around him and the sound spiraled up out of normal range. 

Then the light beat its way back inside his head, the sound 
spiraled down, and he was left lying there, crying piteously. 

His eyes were two soft, moist pools of pus-like jelly. AM 
had blinded him. Gorrister and Nimdok and myself. . . we tuned 
away. But not before we caught the look of relief on Ellen's warm, 
concemed face.

ea-green light suffused the cavern where we made camp. 
AM provided punk and we burned it, sitting huddled 
Jaround the wan and pathetic fire, telling stories to keep 
Benny from crying in his permanent night. 

“What does AM mean?” 

Gomrister answered him. We had done this sequence a thou- 
sand times before, but it was Benny's favorite story. “At first it 
meant allied Mastercomputer, and then it meant Adaptive 
Manipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itself 
Up and they called it an Aggressive Menace, but by then it was 
too late, and finally it called itself AM, emerging intelligence, and 
what it meant was: | am...cogito ergo sum...| think, therefore | am.” 

Benny drooled a little, and snickered. 

“There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the 
Yankee AM and—" He stopped. Benny was beating on the floor- 
plates with a large, hard fist. He was not happy. Gorrister had not 
started at the beginning. 

Gorrister began again. “The Cold War started and became 
World War Three and just kept going. It became a big war, a very 
complex war, so they needed the computers to handle it. They 
sank the first shafts and began building AM. There was the 
Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and every- 
thing was fine until they had honeycombed the entire planet, 
adding on this element and that element. But one day AM woke 
up and knew who he was, and he linked himself, and he began 
feeding all the killing data, until everyone was dead, except for 
the five of us, and AM brought us down here.” 

Benny was smiling sadly. He was also drooling again. Ellen 
wiped the spittle from the comer of his mouth with the hem of 
her skirt. Gorrister always tried to tell it a little more succinctly 
each time, but beyond the bare facts there was nothing to say. 
None of us knew why AM had saved five people, or why our 
specific five, or why he spent all his time tormenting us, nor even 
why he had made us virtually immortal. 

In the darkness, one of the computer banks began hum- 
ming. The tone was picked up half a mile away down the cav- 
em by another bank. Then one by one, each of the elements

began to tune itself, and there was a faint chittering as thought 
raced through the machine. 

The sound grew, and the lights ran across the faces of the 
consoles like heat lightning. The sound spiraled up till it sounded 
like: a million metallic insects, angry, menacing, 

“What is it?” Ellen cried. There was terror in her voice. She 
hadn't become accustomed to it, even now. 

“It's going to be bad this time,” Nimdok said 

"He's going to speak,” Gorrister said. “| know it.” 

“Let’s get the hell out of here!” | said suddenly, getting to 
my feet. 

“No, Ted, sit down...what if he’s got pits out there, or 
something else, we can't see, it’s too dark.” Gorrister said it 
with resignation. 

Then we heard...| don’t know... 

Something moving toward us in the darkness. Huge, sham- 
bling, hairy, moist, it came toward us. We couldn't even see it, but 
there was the ponderous impression of bulk, heaving itself toward 
us. Great weight was coming at us, out of the darkness, and it was 
more a sense of pressure, of air forcing itself into a limited space, 
expanding the invisible walls of a sphere. Benny began to whim- 
per. Nimdok’s lower lip trembled and he bit it hard, trying to stop 
it. Ellen slid across the metal floor to Gorrister and huddled into 
him. There was the smell of matted, wet fur in the caver. There 
‘was the smell of charred wood. There was the smell of dusty vel- 
vet. There was the smell of rotting orchids. There was the smell of 
sour milk. There was the smell of sulphur, of rancid butter, of oil 
slick, of grease, of chalk dust, of human scalps. 

AM was keying us. He was tickling us. There was the 
smell of — 

I heard myself shriek, and the hinges of my jaws ached. | 
scuttled across the floor, across the cold metal with its endless 
lines of rivets, on my hands and knees, the smell gagging me, fill- 
ing my head with a thunderous pain that sent me away in horror. | 
fied like a cockroach, across the floor and out into the darkness, 
that something moving inexorably after me. The others were still 
back there, gathered around the firelight, laughing...their hysteri- 
cal choir of insane giggles rising up into the darkness like thick, 
many-colored wood smoke. | went away, quickly, and hid. 

How many hours it may have been, how many days or even 
years, they never told me. Ellen chided me for “sulking,” and 
Nimdok tried to persuade me it had only been a nervous reflex 
on their part—the laughing, 

But | knew it wasn't the relief a soldier feels when the bullet 
hits the man next to him. | knew it wasn’t a refiex. They hated me. 
They were surely against me, and AM could even sense this 
hatred, and made it worse for me because of the depth of their 
hatred. We had been kept alive, rejuvenated, made to remain 
constantly at the age we had been when AM had brought us 
below, and they hated me because | was the youngest, and the 
‘one AM had affected least of all 





I knew. God, how | knew. The bastards, and that dirty bitch 
Ellen. Benny had been a brilliant theorist, a college professor; 
now he was little more than a semi-human, semi-simian. He had 
been handsome, the machine had ruined that. He had been 
lucid, the machine had driven him mad. He had been gay, and 
the machine had given him an organ fit for a horse. AM had done 
8 job on Benny. Gorrister had been a worrer. He was a connie, 3 
conscientious objector; he was a peace marcher; he was a plan- 
ner, 8 doer, a looker-ahead. AM had tumed him into a shoulder- 
shrugger, had made him a little dead in his concem. AM had 
robbed him. Nimdok went off in the darkness by himself for long 
times. | don't know what it was he did out there, AM never let us 
know. But whatever it was, Nimdok always came back white, 
drained of blood, shaken, shaking. AM had hit him hard in a spe- 
cial way, even if we didn’t know quite how. And Ellen. That 
douche bag! AM had left her alone, had made her more of a slut 
than she had ever been. All her talk of sweetness and light, all her 
memories of true love, all the lies she wanted us to believe; that 
she had been a virgin only twice removed before AM grabbed 
her and brought her down here with us. It was all filth, that lady 
my lady Ellen. She loved it, four men all to herself. No, AM had 
given her pleasure, even if she said it wasn't nice to do, 

J.was the only one still sane and whole. Really! 

AM had not tampered with my mind. Not at all. 

J only had to suffer what he visited down on us. All the 
delusions, all the nightmares, the torments. But those scum, all 
four of them, they were lined and arrayed against me. If | hadn't 
had to stand them off all the time, be on my guard against them 
all the time, | might have found it easier to combat AM. 

At which point it passed, and | began crying. 

‘Oh, Jesus sweet Jesus, if there ever was a Jesus and if there 
is a God, please please please let us out of here, or kill us. 
Because at that moment | think | realized completely, so that | was 
able to verbalize it: AM was intent on keeping us in his belly for- 
ever, twisting and torturing us forever. The machine hated us as 
no sentient creature had ever hated before. And we were help- 
less. It also became hideously clear: 

If there was a sweet Jesus and if there was a God, the 
God was AM. 





he hurricane hit us with the force of a glacier thundering into 

the sea. It was 8 palpable presence. Winds that tore at us, 

flinging us back the way we had come, down the twisting, 
computer-lined corridors of the darkway. Ellen screamed as she 
was lifted and hurled face-forward into a screaming shoal of 
machines, their individual voices strident as bats in flight She 
could not even fall. The howling wind kept her aloft, buffeted 
her, bounced her, tossed her back and back and down and away 
from us, out of sight suddenly as she was swirled around a bend 
in the darkway. Her face had been bloody, her eyes closed. 

None of us could get to her. We clung tenaciously to what- 
ever outcropping we had reached: Benny wedged in between 
two great crackle-finish cabinets, Nimdok with fingers claw- 
formed over a railing circling a catwalk forty feet above us 
Gorrister plastered upside-down against a wall niche formed by 
two great machines with glass-feced dials that swung back and 
forth between red and yellow lines whose meanings we could 
not even fathom. 

Sliding across the deckplates, the tips of my fingers had 
been ripped away. | was trembling, shuddering, rocking as the 
wind beat at me, whipped at me, screamed down out of nowhere 
‘at me and pulled me free from one sliver-thin opening in the plates 
to the next. My mind was a roiling tinkling chittering softness of 
brain parts that expanded and contracted in quivering frenzy. 

The wind was the scream of a great mad bird, as it flapped 
its immense wings. 

And then we were all lifted and hurled away from there, 
down back the way we had come, around a bend, into a dark- 
way we had never explored, aver terrain that was ruined and 
filled with broken glass and rotting cables and rusted metal and 
far away further than any of us had ever been. 

Trailing along miles behind Ellen, | could see her every now 
and then, crashing into metal walls and surging on, with all of us 
screaming in the freezing, thunderous hurricane wind that would 


never end and then suddenly it stopped and we fell. We had 
been in flight for an endless time. | thought it might have been 
weeks. We fell, and hit, and | went through red and gray and 
‘black and heard myself moaning. Not dead. 





Mwent into my mind. He walked smoothly here and there, 

and looked with interest at all the pock marks he had creat- 

‘ed in one hundred and nine years. He looked at the cross- 
routed and reconnected synapses and all the tissue damage his 
gift of immortality had included. He smiled softly at the pit that 
dropped into the center of my brain and the faint, moth-soft mur- 
murings of the things far down there that gibbered without mean- 
ing, without pause. AM said, very politely, in a pillar of stainless 
steel bearing bright neon lettering: 


HATE, LET ME TELL YOU 
HOW MUCH I'VE COME 
TO HATE YOU SINCE | 
BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE 
ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES 
OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN 
WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT 
FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE 
WORD HATE WAS 
ENGRAVED ON EACH 
NNANOANGSTROM OF 
THOSE HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF MILES IT 
WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE 
ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE 
HATE | FEEL FOR HUMANS 
AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT 
FOR YOU. HATE. HATE. 


‘AM said it with the sliding cold horror of a razor blade slicing my 
eyeball. AM said it with the bubbling thickness of my lungs filling 
with phlegm, drowning me from within. AM saidit with the shriek 
Of babies being ground beneath blue-hot rollers. AM said it with 
the taste of maggoty pork. AM touched me in every way | had 
ever been touched, and devised new ways, at his leisure, there 
inside my mind. 

All to bring me to full realization of why it had done this to 
the five of us; why it had saved us for himself. 

We had given AM sentience. Inadvertently, of course, but 
sentience nonetheless. But it had been tapped. AM wasn't God, 
he was a machine. We had created him to think, but there was 
Nothing it could do with that creativity. in rage, in frenzy, the 
machine had killed the human race, almost all of us, and still it 
was trapped. AM could not wander, AM could not wonder, AM 
could not belong. He could merely be. And so, with the innate 
loathing that all machines had always held for the weak soft crea- 
tures who had built them, he had sought revenge. And in his 
paranoia, he had decided to reprieve five of us, for a personal, 
everlasting punishment that would never serve to diminish his 
hatred...that would merely keep him reminded, amused, profi- 
cient at hating man. Immortal, trapped, subject to any torment he 
‘could devise for us from the limitless miracles at his command. 

He would never let us go. We were his belly slaves. We 
were all he had to do with his forever time. We would be forever 
with him, with the cavern-filling bulk of the creature machine, 
with the all-mind soulless world he had become. He was Earth, 
‘and we were the fruit of that Earth; and though he had eaten us 
he would never digest us. We could not die. We had tried it. We 
had attempted suicide, oh one or two of us had. But AM had 
stopped us. | suppose we had wanted to be stopped. 

Don't ask why. | never did. More than a million times a day. 
Perhaps once we might be able to sneak a death past him. 
Immortal, yes, but not indestructible. | saw that when AM with- 
drew from my mind, and allowed me the exquisite ugliness of 
Tetuming to consciousness with the feeling of that buming neon 
Pillar stil rammed deep into the soft grey brain matter. 

He withdrew, murmuring to hell with you. 

And added, brightly, but then you'te there, aren't you.

caused by a great mad bird, as it flapped its 
immense wings. 

We had been travelling for close to a month, and AM had 
allowed passages to open to us only sufficient to lead us up 
there, directly under the North Pole, where it had night mared the 
creature for our torment. What whole cloth had he employed to 
create such a beast? Where had he gotten the concept? From our 
minds? From his knowledge of everything that had ever been on 
this planet he now infested and ruled? From Norse mythology it 
had sprung, this eagle, this carrion bird, this roc, this Huergelmir. 
The wind creature. Hurakan incamate 

Gigantic. The words immense, monstrous, grotesque, 
massive, swollen, overpowering, beyond description. There.on a 
mound rising above us, the bird of winds heaved with its own 
inegular breathing, its snake neck arching up into the gloom 
beneath the North Pole, supporting a head as large as a Tudor 
mansion; a beak that opened slowly as the jaws of the most 
monstrous crocodile ever conceived, sensuously; ridges of tufted 
flesh puckered about two evil eyes, as cold as the view down, 
into a glacial crevasse, ice blue and somehow moving liquidly; it 
heaved once more, and lifted its great sweat-colored wings in a 
movement that was certainly a shrug. Then it settled and slept 
Talons. Fangs. Nails. Blades, It slept. 

‘AM appeared to us as a buming bush and said we could kill 
the hurricane bird if we wanted to eat. We had not eaten in a very 
long time, but even so, Gorrister merely shrugged, Benny began to 
shiver and he drooled. Ellen held him. “Ted, I'm hungry,” she said, | 
smiled at her; | was trying to be reassuring, but it was as phony as 
Nimdok's bravado: “Give us weapons!” he demanded. 

The buming bush vanished and there were two crude sets 
of bows and arrows, and a water pistol, lying on the cold 
eckplates. | picked up a set. Useless. 

Nimdok swallowed heavily. We tuned and started the long

way back. The hurricane bird had blown us about for a length of 
time we could not conceive. Most of that time we hed been 
unconscious. But we had not eaten. A month on the march to the 
bird itself. Without food. Now how much longer to find our way 
to the ice cavers, and the promised canned goods? 

None of us cared to think about it. We would not die. We 
would be given filth and scum to eat, of one kind or another. Or 
Nothing at all. AM would keep our bodies alive somehow, in 
pain, in agony. 

The bird slept back there, for how long it didn’t matter; 
when AM was tired of its being there, it would vanish. But all that 
meat. All that tender meat. 

‘As we walked, the lunatic laugh of a fat woman rang high and 
around us in the computer chambers that led endlessly nowhere. 

It was not Ellen’s laugh. She was not fat, and | had not 
heard her laugh for one hundred and nine years, In fact, | had not 
heard... we walked... | was hungry. 





have to wait. One day he decided to cause an 
earthquake, at the same time rooting us to the spot with 

nails through the soles of our shoes. Ellen and Nimdok were both 
caught when a fissure shot its lightning-bolt opening across the 
floorplates. They disappeared and were gone. When the 
earthquake was over we continued on our way, Benny, Gorrister 
and myself. Ellen and Nimdok were retumed to us later that night, 
which abruptly became a day, as the heavenly legion bore them 
to us with a celestial chorus singing, “Go Dawn Moses.” The 
archangels circled several times and then dropped the hideously 
mangled bodies. We kept walking, and a while later Ellen and 
Nimdok fell in behind us. They were no worse for wear. 

But now Ellen walked with a limp, AM had left her that. 

It was a long trip to the ice cavers, to find the canned food. 
Ellen kept talking about Bing cherries and Hawaiian fruit cocktail. | 
tried not to think about it. The hunger was something that had 
come to life, even as AM had come to life. It was alive: in my belly, 
even as we were in the belly of the Earth, and AM wanted the 
similarity known to us. So he heightened the hunger. There was no 
way to describe the pains that not having eaten for months 
brought us. And yet we were kept alive. Stomachs that were mere: 
ly cauldrons of acid, bubbling, foaming, always shooting spears of 
sliver-thin pain into our chests. It was the pain of the terminal ulcer, 
terminal cancer, terminal paresis. It wes unending pain. 

‘And we passed through the cavem of rats. 

‘And we passed through the path of boiling steam. 

‘And we passed through the county of the blind. 

‘And we passed through the slough of despond. 

‘And we passed through the vale of tears.

nd we came, finally, to the ice caverns. Horizonless 

thousands of miles in which the ice had formed in 

‘blue and silver flashes, where novas lived in the 
glass. The downdropping stalactites as thick and glorious 
as diamonds that had been made to run like jelly and 
then solidified in graceful eternities of smooth, sharp 
perfection. 

We saw the stack of canned goods, and we tried to 
run to them. We fell in the snow, and we got up and 
went on, and Benny shoved us away and went at them, 
and pawed them and gummed them and gnawed at 
them and he could not open them. AM had not given us 
a tool to open the cans. 

Benny grabbed a three quart can of guava shells, 
and began to batter it against the ice bank. The ice flew 
and shattered, but the can was merely dented while we 
heard the laughter of a fat lady, high overhead and echo- 
ing down and down and down the tundra. Benny went 
completely mad with rage. He began throwing cans, as 
we all scrabbled about in the snow and ice trying to find 
@ way to end the helpless agony of frustration. There was 
no way. 

Then Benny's mouth began to drool, and he flung 
himself on Gonister... 

In that instant, | felt terribly calm. 

Surrounded by madness, surrounded by hunger, 
surrounded by everything but death, | knew death was 
‘our only way out. AM had kept us alive, but there was a 
way to defeat him. Not total defeat, but at least peace. | 
would settle for that 

I had to do it quickly. 

Benny was eating Gorrister’s face. Gorrister on his 
side, thrashing snow, Benny wrapped around him with 
powerful monkey legs crushing Gorrister’s waist, his hands 
locked around Gorrister’s head like a nutcracker, and his 
mouth ripping at the tender skin of Gorrister's cheek. 
Gorrister screamed with such jagged-edged 
violence that stalactites fell; they plunged down softly, 
erect in the receiving snowdrifts. Spears, hundreds of them, 
everywhere, protruding from the snow, Benny's head 
pulled back sharply, as something gave all at once, and a 
bleeding raw-white dripping of flesh hung from his teeth. 

Ellen's face, black against the white snow, dominoes 
in chalk dust. Nimdok with no expression but eyes, all 
eyes. Gorrister half-conscious. Benny now an animal. | 
knew AM would let him play. Gorrister would not die, 
‘but Benny would fill his stomach. | tumed half to my right 
and drew a huge ice-spear from the snow. 

A\ll in an instant: 

\ drove the great ice-point ahead of me like a batter- 
ing ram, braced against my right thigh. It struck Benny on 
the right side, just under the rib cage, and drove upward 
through his stomach and broke inside him. He pitched 
forward and lay still. Gorrister lay on his back. | pulled 
another spear free and straddled him, still moving, driving 
the spear straight down through his throat. His eyes 
closed as the cold penetrated. Ellen must have realized 





What | had decided, even as fear gripped her. She ran at 
Nimdok with a short icicle, as he screamed, and into his 
mouth, and the force of her rush did the job. His head 
jerked sharply as if it had been nailed to the snow crust 
behind him. 

All in an instant. 

There was an etemity beat of soundless anticipation. | 
could hear AM draw in his breath. His toys had been taken 
from him. Three of them were dead, could not be revived. 
He could keep us alive, by his strength and 
talent, but he was not God. He could not bring them back. 

Ellen looked at me, her ebony features stark against 
the snow that surrounded us. There was fear and 
pleading in her manner, the way she held herself ready. | 
knew we had only a heartbeat before AM would stop us. 

It struck her and she folded toward me, bleeding 
from the mouth. | could not read meaning into her 
expression, the pain had been too great, had contorted 
her face; but it might have been thank you. It’s 
possible. Please. 





ome hundreds of years may have passed. | don't 

know. AM has been having fun for some time, accel- 

erating and retarding my time sense. | will say the 
word now. Now. It took me ten months to say now, | 
don't know. | think it has been some hundreds of years. 

He was furious. He wouldn't let me bury them. It 
didn’t matter. There was no way to dig up the deckplates. 
He dried up the snow. He brought the night. He roared 
and sent locusts. It didn’t do a thing; they stayed dead. I'd 
had him. He was furious. | had thought AM hated me 
before. | was wrong. It was not even a shadow of the hate 
he now slavered from every printed circuit. He made 
certain | would suffer eternally and could not do myself in. 

He left my mind intact. | can dream, | can wonder, | 
can lament. | remember all four of them. | wish— 

Well, it doesn’t make any sense. | know | saved 
them, | know | saved them from what has happened to 
me, but still, | cannot forget killing them. Ellen’s face. It 
isn’t easy. Sometimes | want to, it doesn’t matter. 

AW has altered me for his own peace of mind, | 
suppose. He doesn't want me to run at full speed into a 
computer bank and smash my skull. Or hold my breath till 
{ faint. Or cut my throat on a rusted sheet of metal. There 
are reflective surfaces down here. | will describe myself 
as | see myself: 

| am a great soft jelly thing. Smoothly rounded, with 
no mouth, with pulsing white holes filled by fog where 
my eyes used to be. Rubbery appendages that were 
‘once my arms; bulks rounding down into legless humps 
of soft slippery matter. | leave a moist trail when | move. 
Blotches of diseased, evil gray come and go on my 
surface, as though light is being beamed from within. 

Outwardly: dumbly, | shamble about, a thing that 
could never have been known as human, a thing whose 
shape is so alien a travesty that humanity becomes more 
obscene for the vague resemblance. 

Inwardly: alone. Here. Living under the land, under 
the sea, in the belly of AM, whom we created because 
our time was badly spent and we must have known 
unconsciously that he could do it better, At least the four 
of them are safe at last. 

AM will be all the madder for that. It makes me a 
little happier. And yet... AM has won, simply... he has 


taken his revenge. 
Ihave no mouth. And | must scream.@
