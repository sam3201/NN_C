## What I do
- Deep dive into code structure and architecture
- Identify design patterns and anti-patterns
- Suggest refactoring opportunities
- Analyze module dependencies and coupling
- Review for performance bottlenecks

## When to use me
Use this skill when:
- Analyzing a new codebase
- Refactoring existing code
- Reviewing architecture decisions
- Identifying technical debt
- Planning new features that require architectural changes

## Analysis Process
1. **Structure Discovery**: Map the directory structure and file organization
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify design patterns, code smells, and anti-patterns
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Check module coupling and cohesion
4. **Performance Review**: Identify potential bottlenecks
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Provide actionable refactoring suggestions

## Example Usage
"Analyze the src/ directory structure and suggest architectural improvements"
"Review the module dependencies in complete_sam_unified.py"
"Identify code smells and anti-patterns in the C extension modules"
