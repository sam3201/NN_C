## What I do
- Conduct systematic line-by-line analysis of large documents
- Extract technical specifications and equations
- Build comprehensive documentation from scattered information
- Research academic sources and synthesize findings
- Create detailed extraction notes with findings

## When to use me
Use this skill when:
- Processing large chatlogs or documents (3000+ lines)
- Extracting technical specifications from conversations
- Building version history from multiple sources
- Researching equations and mathematical formulations
- Documenting system architecture discoveries

## Research Methodology
1. **Line-by-Line Scanning**: Process documents systematically in chunks
2. **Parallel Delegation**: Use subagents to read ahead, process current, and write behind
3. **Real-time Documentation**: Continuously append findings to notes
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify version numbers, equations, and architectural patterns
5. **Synthesis**: Combine findings into coherent documentation

## Research Areas
- Mathematical formulations and equations
- System architecture components
- Version history and evolution
- Implementation specifications
- Technical constraints and requirements

## Example Usage
"Research and extract all technical specifications from this 3000-line chatlog"
"Conduct deep scan of the codebase and document all neural network components"
"Systematically extract equations and version history from conversation logs"
