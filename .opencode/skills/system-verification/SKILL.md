## What I do
- Verify all system components are documented
- Check for missing implementations
- Ensure version history is complete
- Validate architectural consistency
- Identify gaps in documentation or code

## When to use me
Use this skill when:
- Finalizing a project phase
- Preparing for release
- Reviewing system completeness
- Checking documentation coverage
- Verifying integration points

## Verification Checklist
1. **Component Inventory**: Verify all modules are documented
2. **Version History**: Check all versions are tracked
3. **Implementation Status**: Confirm what's built vs planned
4. **Documentation Coverage**: Ensure all parts are explained
5. **Integration Points**: Verify connections between components
6. **Missing Pieces**: Identify gaps in architecture
7. **Consistency Check**: Ensure naming and patterns are consistent

## Example Usage
"Verify that all 53 regulators are properly documented"
"Check if version history covers all chat sessions"
"Ensure the S³-D³ architecture is completely documented"
"Validate that all equations have been extracted and documented"
