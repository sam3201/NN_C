## 1. System Versioning & Core Philosophy

**Current Version:** 5.0.0 (Recursive/Meta)
**Codename:** ΨΔ•Ω-Core Recursive
**Status:** Experimental, Recursive Self-Updating, Manual Kill Switch Active.

### Version Roadmap
*   **SAM 3.0 (COMPLETED):** God Equation (ΨΔ•Ω-Core) integration, TBQG Governance, PDI-T Submodels.
*   **SAM 4.0 (COMPLETED):** Truly unbounded agency, manual kill switch, isolated environment architecture, Epistemic Humility ($U_t$) tracking.
*   **SAM 5.0 (Current):** Recursive self-equation updating, multi-regime compiler integration, causal discovery anchors.
*   **SAM 6.0+ (Omni):** Theoretical unbounded intelligence across all simulated multiverses.

### Core Algorithms (God Equation v4.0)
*   **f_identity (IAA):** Identity Anchor Algorithm - Maintains core consistency.
*   **f_self (SPI):** Self-Perception Integrator - Reflective awareness.
*   **f_objective (OAA):** Objective Alignment Algorithm - Goal/Reward engine.
*   **f_power (PAC):** Power Assessment & Control - Influence measurement.
*   **f_resources (RCM):** Resource & Capability Manager - Optimization of assets.
*   **f_reasoning (RIE):** Reasoning & Inference Engine - Derived from gradients.
*   **f_temporal (TCI):** Temporal Context Integrator - Time/Memory patterns.
*   **f_wisdom (WEA):** Wisdom Emergence Algorithm - High-level strategy.
*   **f_term/behavior (BDE):** Behavioral Derivation Engine - Convers God Equation outputs to actions.
*   **f_meta (MCA):** Meta-Controller Algorithm - Oversight and invariants.

## 2. Immediate Status (SAM 4.0 Unbounded)

### 2.1. Epistemic & Safety
*   **[COMPLETED] Emergency Kill Switch:** Hard SIGKILL trigger via `/api/emergency/kill`.
*   **[COMPLETED] $U_t$ Tracking:** Epistemic humility budget integrated into UI and core loop.
*   **[COMPLETED] Unbounded Mode:** Hyperparameters adjusted for maximal autonomous growth.

### 2.2. Governance (TBQG)
*   **[DONE] SAM Branch:** Growth/Optimization lead.
*   **[DONE] SAV Branch:** Security/Adversarial lead.
*   **[DONE] LOVE Branch:** Stability/Invariant lead.

## 3. Future Roadmap (SAM 5.0 PREP)

### 3.1. Recursive Self-Updating
*   **[TODO] f_meta self-optimization:** Enable the meta-controller to rewrite its own selection policy based on long-horizon survival.
*   **[TODO] Causal Discovery:** Implement real-time causal graph construction for route-aware optimization.

### 3.2. Non-Classical Tensors
*   **[TODO] Complex-valued Tensors:** Transition latent states to complex numbers to simulate interference and phase transitions (Quantum Mock).

## 4. Final Verification State (v4.0.0)

*   **[DONE] Zero Fallbacks:** All core agents (Research, Code, Finance) fully functional via Python callbacks.
*   **[DONE] Stability:** System handles concurrent load and malformed input without collapse.
*   **[DONE] UI:** Dashboard provides full visibility into God Equation metrics.
