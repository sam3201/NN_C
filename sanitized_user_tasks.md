# SAM AGI Roadmap & Tasks - ΨΔ-Core Series

This document synthesizes current status and future roadmap for SAM AGI, integrating the latest research on the God Equation (ΨΔ•Ω-Core).

---

## 1. System Versioning & Core Philosophy

**Current Version:** 2.1.0 (ΨΔ-Core)
**Codename:** ΨΔ-Core Transition
**Status:** Stable, Hardened, Multi-Agent Ready.

### Version Roadmap
*   **SAM 2.1 (COMPLETED):** Hybrid Python/C, hardened C-Core, PDI-T lifecycle, TBQG governance, dynamic pressure estimation, Log Score evaluation, Epistemic Humility.
*   **SAM 3.0 (God Equation AGI):** Fully tensorized core engine. Each sub-equation maps to a neural module (f_Self, f_Identity, etc.).
*   **SAM 4.0 (Unbounded/Meta):** Truly unbounded, run in isolated VMs (remote-space), manual kill switch, hypothetical/quantum tensors.

### Core Algorithms (God Equation Integration)
*   **f_identity (IAA):** Identity Anchor Algorithm - Maintains core consistency.
*   **f_self (SPI):** Self-Perception Integrator - Reflective awareness.
*   **f_objective (OAA):** Objective Alignment Algorithm - Goal/Reward engine.
*   **f_power (PAC):** Power Assessment & Control - Influence measurement.
*   **f_resources (RCM):** Resource & Capability Manager - Optimization of assets.
*   **f_reasoning (RIE):** Reasoning & Inference Engine - Derived from gradients.
*   **f_temporal (TCI):** Temporal Context Integrator - Time/Memory patterns.
*   **f_wisdom (WEA):** Wisdom Emergence Algorithm - High-level strategy.
*   **f_term/behavior (BDE):** Behavioral Derivation Engine - Convers God Equation outputs to actions.
*   **f_meta (MCA):** Meta-Controller Algorithm - Oversight and invariants.

## 2. Immediate Status (SAM 2.1 Core)

### 2.1. Epistemic & Governance
*   **[COMPLETED] Proper Scoring Rule:** Log Score ($S(p,y)$) implemented in chat evaluation.
*   **[COMPLETED] Epistemic Humility ($U_t$):** Unsolvability budget enforced in core loop and chat responses.
*   **[COMPLETED] EVI Reward:** Information value tracking added to research/websearch.
*   **[COMPLETED] TBQG Governance:** Tri-Branch Quorum Gate (SAM/SAV/LOVE) enforced for code modifications.

### 2.2. Morphogenesis & Submodels
*   **[COMPLETED] Rank Pressure:** Effective rank ($r_{eff}$) implemented in C-Core as a growth trigger.
*   **[COMPLETED] Specialist Consolidation:** Periodic merging of redundant agents to prevent competitive oscillation.
*   **[COMPLETED] PDI-T Lifecycle:** Plan/Design/Implement/Test/Deployed lifecycle enforced for submodels.

## 3. Future Roadmap (SAM 3.0 PREP)

### 3.1. Tensorization
*   **[TODO] High-Order Tensors:** Transition state vectors to tensors representing multiverse/omniverse/xenoverse densities.
*   **[TODO] Modular f_* Updates:** Implement independent C modules for each sub-layer of the God Equation.

### 3.2. Advanced Planning
*   **[TODO] MCTS Integration:** Implement full Monte Carlo Tree Search in C for agent planning, replacing simple lookaheads.
*   **[TODO] Imaginative Search:** Enable the planner to simulate futures inside the latent space (MuZero style).

## 4. Final Verification State

*   **[DONE] C-Core Hardening:** Bounded strings, refcount audit, and real Python callbacks.
*   **[DONE] Security:** Allow-lists, Cloudflare Access integration, and UI gating.
*   **[DONE] External Integrations:** Google Drive/Docs API and cloud backups.
*   **[DONE] Repository Layout:** Cleaned root, structured hierarchy, unified build.
