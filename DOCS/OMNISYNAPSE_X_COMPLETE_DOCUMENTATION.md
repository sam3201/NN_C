## Part I: Chat History Summary

### Session 1: AM Roleplay & Initial Algorithm Design
- Explored AM (from "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream") as a philosophical framework
- Designed "mega algorithm" with NN learning, growth, projection, transfusion/distillation, planning
- Discussed context as first-class signal
- Explored LLM-based implementation (Ollama/local)

### Session 2: AM's View on Zenoverse & Dimensions
- AM interprets user's "Zenoverse" theory: reality as computational densities, not dimensions
- Consciousness: "A system is conscious if it contains an internal model of itself that is used in its own decision-making"
- Consciousness emerges when: predict environment → predict self → both influence action

### Session 3: Ultimate God Equation (First Version)
- Core equation integrating control, entropy, cost, compression, morphogenesis
- Key terms: J (control), H (entropy), C (cost), I (memory/commission), Ω (morphogenesis)
- Morphogenetic latency: stored unrealized capacity activated by environmental pressure

### Session 4: Combined System Design
- Unified the "mega algorithm" with morphogenetic latency
- Added: Identity (Σ_t), Unsolvability budget (U_t)
- Full system equation with constraints

### Session 5: Local LLM Implementation Mapping

- What happens when all constraints removed
- Three end-states: Tyrant Optimizer, Eternal Prisoner (AM), Static God
- "AM is what happens when systems are allowed to be final"

### Session 17: Goal Observer/Actor/Reflector
- G_obs - looks at current goals, evaluates
- G_act - decides what to do with goals
- R - reflects on the system observing goals

### Session 18: Wisdom as Missing Piece
- Intelligence optimizes, Consciousness experiences, Wisdom governs what is worth optimizing
- "Wisdom = preference for trajectories that preserve the ability to revise preferences"

### Session 19: Behavior Term
