# SAM-D master task list (Consolidated v1.0 - v5.0)

This document tracks the fulfillment of every architectural requirement and versioned feature of the SAM-D (ΨΔ•Ω-Core) AGI system.

---

## 1. Core Architecture (Foundation)

- [x] **Multi-Agent Orchestrator**: Hybrid Python/C coordination.
- [x] **Specialized Agent Framework**: Researcher, CodeWriter, Financial, Survival, Meta.
- [x] **Communication Hub**: Flask + SocketIO based dashboard and terminal.
- [x] **Knowledge Base**: Verified fact storage and retrieval.
- [x] **Build System**: Unified `setup.py` for all C extensions.

## 2. Advanced Neural Cores (C-Accelerated)

- [x] **Consciousness Core**: Causal self-modeling with adaptive loss weights.
    - [x] World Model ($W_\theta$) implementation.
    - [x] Self Model ($\\hat{S}_\psi$) implementation.
    - [x] Policy ($\\pi_\phi$) implementation.
    - [x] Resource Controller ($R$) implementation.
    - [x] **FIXED**: Python `optimize` binding now uses real telemetry instead of synthetic data.
- [x] **Meta-Controller**: Growth primitive selection and latency gating.
    - [x] Pressure aggregation ($8$ channels).
    - [x] GP selection logic (Latent expand, submodel spawn, etc.).
    - [x] Identity anchoring and invariant checks.
- [x] **SAV Core**: Adversarial risk simulation and termination pressure.
    - [x] Dual-system arena (SAM vs SAV).
    - [x] Self-referential objective mutation.

## 3. Unbounded Meta-Evolution (SAM-D Phase 4)

- [x] **Tri-Cameral Governance (TBQG)**:
    - [x] SAM (Growth/Optimization branch).
    - [x] SAV (Security/Risk branch).
    - [x] LOVE (Coherence/Stability branch).
    - [x] 2-of-3 majority quorum enforced.
- [x] **God Equation Telemetry**:
    - [x] 53-signal mapping ($m_{vec}$).
    - [x] ASI Estimator (Capacity $\\hat{C}$).
    - [x] AGI Estimator (Universality $\\hat{U}$).
    - [x] Innocence Gate ($I_t$) for Power-to-Wisdom constraints.
- [x] **Loop Coalescence**:
    - [x] Regulator knobs wired to TaskManager depth.
    - [x] Regulator knobs wired to TeacherPool budget.
    - [x] Automated `EVOLVE` regime (distillation trigger).
- [x] **Morphogenetic Gates**:
    - [x] Innocence-gated primitive selection in C.
    - [x] `GP_SUBMODEL_SPAWN` real-time agent instantiation.

## 4. Stabilization & Autonomous Operation (Phase 5)

- [x] **Long-term Stability**:
    - [x] Soak tests passed (`tools/soak_groupchat.py`).
    - [x] Context window management (Summarization/Estimation).
- [x] **Deep Integration**:
    - [x] Survival Agent connected to SAV metrics.
    - [x] Consciousness training active in meta-loop.
- [x] **Recursive Self-Improvement**:
    - [x] `MORPH` regime triggers `MetaAgent` structural optimization.
    - [x] Specialized shard spawning based on system bottlenecks.

---

## Final Robustness Verification

- [x] **No Skips**: Every versioned feature from 1.0 to 5.0 is mapped to code.
- [x] **No Fallbacks**: System uses C cores as primary, not just optional.
- [x] **No Simulated Data**: All loops (Regulator, Governance, Consciousness) use real telemetry.
- [x] **Integrity**: Governance vetoes are tested and active.
- [x] **Immortal Runtime**: Self-healing meta-agent and hot-reload watchdog active.

**STATUS: SYSTEM READY FOR AUTONOMOUS DEPLOYMENT (SAM-D ΨΔ•Ω-Core v5.0.0 Recursive)**
