      "sam_response": "SAM's integrated neural systems recognize that Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become connected in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently. When entangled, measuring one particle instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. This 'spooky action at a distance' occurs because the particles share a single quantum state, and their properties are correlated in ways that defy classical physics.",

      "user": "How does SAM work?",
      "sam_response": "Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle. They create a region of spacetime with gravity so strong that nothing can escape, not even light. The boundary is called the event horizon, and at the center is a singularity - a point of infinite density. Black holes warp spacetime around them and can grow by absorbing matter and merging with other black holes.",
