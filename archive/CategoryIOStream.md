# CategoryIOStream

SDL provides an abstract interface for reading and writing data streams. It
offers implementations for files, memory, etc, and the app can provide
their own implementations, too.

[SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream) is not related to the standard C++ iostream
class, other than both are abstract interfaces to read/write data.
