  "correct_answer": "Evolution is the process by which species change over generations through genetic variation and natural selection. Organisms with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those advantageous traits to offspring. Over millions of years, this process leads to the diversity of life we see today, with species adapting to their environments and new species emerging from existing ones.",
