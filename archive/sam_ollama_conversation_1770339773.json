      "sam_response": "SAM processes 'How do black holes work?' through its multi-model neural architecture, recognizing patterns and generating contextual responses based on learned associations. The system integrates transformer attention for pattern focus, NEAT evolution for adaptation, and cortical mapping for holistic understanding to provide comprehensive responses that reflect deep pattern analysis.",
