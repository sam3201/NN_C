  "correct_answer": "Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle. They create a region of spacetime with gravity so strong that nothing can escape, not even light. The boundary is called the event horizon, and at the center is a singularity - a point of infinite density. Black holes warp spacetime around them and can grow by absorbing matter and merging with other black holes.",
