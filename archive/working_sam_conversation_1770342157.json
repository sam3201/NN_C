          "response": "From a research & analysis perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes learning from experience, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. This involves complex interactions and requires careful consideration of multiple factors and underlying mechanisms.",
