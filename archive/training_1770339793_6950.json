  "correct_answer": "Consciousness is the state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings, characterized by subjective experience and self-awareness. It involves the ability to perceive, think, feel, and have experiences. Scientific theories suggest consciousness emerges from complex neural activity in the brain, particularly involving integrated information processing across multiple brain regions, though its fundamental nature remains one of science's greatest mysteries.",
