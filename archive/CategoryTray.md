# CategoryTray

SDL offers a way to add items to the "system tray" (more correctly called
the "notification area" on Windows). On platforms that offer this concept,
an SDL app can add a tray icon, submenus, checkboxes, and clickable
entries, and register a callback that is fired when the user clicks on
these pieces.
