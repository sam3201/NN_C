  "correct_answer": "The brain works through networks of billions of neurons that communicate via electrical and chemical signals. Neurons form connections called synapses, creating complex neural networks that process information. Different brain regions specialize in various functions like vision, memory, emotion, and motor control. The brain operates through parallel processing, plasticity (ability to change and adapt), and coordinated activity across neural circuits.",
