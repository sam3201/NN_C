# CategoryTimer

SDL provides time management functionality. It is useful for dealing with
(usually) small durations of time.

This is not to be confused with _calendar time_ management, which is
provided by [CategoryTime](CategoryTime).

This category covers measuring time elapsed
([SDL_GetTicks](SDL_GetTicks)(),
[SDL_GetPerformanceCounter](SDL_GetPerformanceCounter)()), putting a thread
to sleep for a certain amount of time ([SDL_Delay](SDL_Delay)(),
[SDL_DelayNS](SDL_DelayNS)(), [SDL_DelayPrecise](SDL_DelayPrecise)()), and
firing a callback function after a certain amount of time has elapsed
([SDL_AddTimer](SDL_AddTimer)(), etc).

There are also useful macros to convert between time units, like
[SDL_SECONDS_TO_NS](SDL_SECONDS_TO_NS)() and such.
