## 📊 **MODEL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**

### **Stage 1: Character Model** ✅
```
Input: "the" → Output: Character sequence
Status: Working perfectly
Capability: Basic pattern recognition
Model: stage1_fixed_final.bin (22MB)
```

### **Stage 2: Word Model** ✅
```
Input: "the dark and" → Output: "be" 
Status: Working (needs refinement)
Capability: Word-level prediction
Model: stage2_word_final.bin (22MB)
```

### **Current Behavior Analysis**

## 🔄 **NEXT STEPS: STAGE 3 IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Stage 3: Word Grouping Training**
**Goal**: Teach the model to generate meaningful phrases and word groups

### **Implementation Plan**
```c
// Phrase structures
typedef struct {
    char words[5][50];     // 2-5 word phrases
    int word_count;
    long double *phrase_vector;
} Phrase;

// Collocation patterns  
typedef struct {
    char word1[50];
    char word2[50];
    int frequency;
    long double association_strength;
} Collocation;
```

### **Training Strategy**
1. **Phrase Extraction**: Extract 2-5 word phrases from text
2. **Collocation Analysis**: Learn word associations
3. **Context Patterns**: Understand phrase contexts
4. **Generation Training**: Train phrase-to-phrase prediction

### **Expected Outcomes**
```
Input: "the dark" → Output: "stormy night"
Input: "i am" → Output: "become death"
Input: "life and" → Output: "death itself"
```
