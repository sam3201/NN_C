# CategoryMessagebox

SDL offers a simple message box API, which is useful for simple alerts,
such as informing the user when something fatal happens at startup without
the need to build a UI for it (or informing the user _before_ your UI is
ready).

These message boxes are native system dialogs where possible.

There is both a customizable function
([SDL_ShowMessageBox](SDL_ShowMessageBox)()) that offers lots of options
for what to display and reports on what choice the user made, and also a
much-simplified version
([SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox](SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox)()), merely takes a
text message and title, and waits until the user presses a single "OK" UI
button. Often, this is all that is necessary.
