# CategoryHints

This file contains functions to set and get configuration hints, as well as
listing each of them alphabetically.

The convention for naming hints is [SDL_HINT_X](SDL_HINT_X), where
"[SDL_X](SDL_X)" is the environment variable that can be used to override
the default.

In general these hints are just that - they may or may not be supported or
applicable on any given platform, but they provide a way for an application
or user to give the library a hint as to how they would like the library to
work.
