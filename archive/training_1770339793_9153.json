  "correct_answer": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become connected in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently. When entangled, measuring one particle instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. This 'spooky action at a distance' occurs because the particles share a single quantum state, and their properties are correlated in ways that defy classical physics.",
