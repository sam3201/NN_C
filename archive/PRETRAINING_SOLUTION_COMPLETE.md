### **✅ Sample Pre-trained P vs NP Response**
```
🤖 Llama2 P vs NP Analysis:

"The P vs NP problem represents a fundamental question about computational complexity. 
Based on extensive analysis of computational theory and empirical evidence:

Key insights:
• No polynomial-time algorithms have been found for NP-complete problems despite decades of effort
• Relativization and natural proof barriers limit current proof techniques
• Quantum computing (BQP) doesn't appear to solve NP-complete problems efficiently
• The consensus among theoretical computer scientists strongly favors P ≠ NP

However, the absence of a proof after 50+ years suggests we may need fundamentally new mathematical techniques.
Current approaches like geometric complexity theory and circuit complexity face significant technical barriers.

Confidence assessment: 75% that P ≠ NP, but 25% uncertainty remains due to historical mathematical surprises."
