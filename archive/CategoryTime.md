# CategoryTime

SDL realtime clock and date/time routines.

There are two data types that are used in this category:
[SDL_Time](SDL_Time), which represents the nanoseconds since a specific
moment (an "epoch"), and [SDL_DateTime](SDL_DateTime), which breaks time
down into human-understandable components: years, months, days, hours, etc.

Much of the functionality is involved in converting those two types to
other useful forms.
