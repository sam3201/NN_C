      "question": "What is quantum entanglement?",
      "expected": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become connected in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently. When entangled, measuring one particle instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. This 'spooky action at a distance' occurs because the particles share a single quantum state, and their properties are correlated in ways that defy classical physics.",

      "question": "How do black holes work?",
      "expected": "Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle. They create a region of spacetime with gravity so strong that nothing can escape, not even light. The boundary is called the event horizon, and at the center is a singularity - a point of infinite density. Black holes warp spacetime around them and can grow by absorbing matter and merging with other black holes.",

Common perspectives include finding purpose through relationships, contributing to society, personal growth, spiritual fulfillment, or creating meaning through one's actions and choices. Many philosophers suggest that meaning is not discovered but created through how we choose to live.",

This includes learning from experience, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI ranges from narrow AI (designed for specific tasks) to general AI (with human-like intelligence across domains), using techniques like machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning.",

Neurons form connections called synapses, creating complex neural networks that process information. Different brain regions specialize in various functions like vision, memory, emotion, and motor control. The brain operates through parallel processing, plasticity (ability to change and adapt), and coordinated activity across neural circuits.",
