# CategorySensor

SDL sensor management.

These APIs grant access to gyros and accelerometers on various platforms.

In order to use these functions, [SDL_Init](SDL_Init)() must have been
called with the [SDL_INIT_SENSOR](SDL_INIT_SENSOR) flag. This causes SDL to
scan the system for sensors, and load appropriate drivers.
